# ADR-005: Analysis of YouTube Whisper API Tutorial and Implementation Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Date
2025-07-06

## Context

This ADR analyzes the YouTube video "Transcribe YouTube Videos in Minutes with OpenAI's Whisper API" by James Phoenix (Video ID: hZhBE3hw5P4) to extract key insights and best practices for our Python transcript processing microservice implementation.

### Video Analysis Summary

**Author**: James Phoenix  
**Duration**: 6 minutes 7 seconds (367 seconds)  
**Topic**: Using OpenAI Whisper API to transcribe YouTube videos  
**Key Technologies Covered**: OpenAI Whisper API, yt-dlp, FFmpeg, Python

### Key Insights from Video Content

#### 1. Technology Stack Validation
The video validates several technology choices we made in ADR-004:

- ✅ **yt-dlp over youtube-dl**: Author specifically mentions yt-dlp is "more up to date more frequently" and handles YouTube's streaming changes better
- ✅ **OpenAI Whisper API**: Demonstrates the API's effectiveness and ease of use
- ✅ **FFmpeg**: Shows FFmpeg usage for video-to-audio conversion
- ✅ **Cost Efficiency**: Author mentions costs are "very cheap though negligible like pennies"

#### 2. Processing Pipeline Insights
The video demonstrates a clear processing pipeline:

1. **Download Video**: Using yt-dlp to download YouTube video
2. **Format Conversion**: Using FFmpeg to convert video to MP3 audio
3. **API Call**: Sending audio to OpenAI Whisper API
4. **Response Processing**: Handling different response formats (text vs. verbose JSON)

#### 3. API Response Formats
The video shows two key response formats from Whisper API:

**Simple Text Response**:
```python
# Returns just the full transcript text
transcript.text
```

**Verbose JSON Response**:
```json
{
  "segments": [
    {
      "start": 0.0,
      "end": 78.0,
      "text": "transcript segment",
      "tokens": [...],
      "temperature": 0.0,
      "avg_logprob": -0.x,
      "compression_ratio": x.x,
      "no_speech_prob": 0.x
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. Timestamp Processing
The video demonstrates timestamp formatting:
```python
# Extract minutes and seconds from start time
start_minutes, start_seconds = divmod(segment['start'], 60)
timestamp = f"{int(start_minutes):02d}:{int(start_seconds):02d}"
```

#### 5. Limitations Identified
- **Multi-speaker Challenges**: "not particularly good when you have more than one speaker"
- **Best Use Cases**: "works best for like tutorials or podcasts things where there's just one speaker at a time"

## Decision

Based on this analysis, we will refine our Python microservice implementation to incorporate the demonstrated best practices while addressing the identified limitations.

### Implementation Refinements

#### 1. Enhanced Technology Stack
```python
# Core dependencies based on video insights
dependencies = {
    "yt-dlp": ">=2023.12.30",  # Preferred over youtube-dl
    "openai": ">=1.0.0",       # For Whisper API access
    "ffmpeg-python": ">=0.2.0", # Python wrapper for FFmpeg
    "pydantic": ">=2.0.0",     # Data validation
    "fastapi": ">=0.100.0",    # Web framework
}
```

#### 2. Processing Pipeline Implementation
```python
class TranscriptProcessor:
    async def process_video(self, youtube_url: str, request_id: str) -> TranscriptResult:
        """Enhanced processing pipeline based on video insights"""
        
        try:
            # 1. Download video using yt-dlp (not youtube-dl)
            video_info = await self.download_video(youtube_url)
            
            # 2. Convert to audio using FFmpeg
            audio_file = await self.convert_to_audio(video_info.filepath)
            
            # 3. Call Whisper API with verbose response for timestamps
            transcript_response = await self.transcribe_with_whisper(
                audio_file, 
                response_format="verbose_json"  # Get detailed segments
            )
            
            # 4. Process timestamps using divmod approach from video
            formatted_segments = self.format_timestamps(transcript_response.segments)
            
            # 5. Generate confidence scores and metadata
            result = self.create_transcript_result(formatted_segments, transcript_response)
            
            return result
            
        finally:
            # Always clean up temporary files
            await self.cleanup_temp_files([video_info.filepath, audio_file])
```

#### 3. Whisper API Integration Strategy
```python
class WhisperAPIClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
    
    async def transcribe_audio(self, audio_file_path: str, format: str = "verbose_json"):
        """
        Transcribe audio using OpenAI Whisper API
        Based on video demonstration of API usage
        """
        with open(audio_file_path, "rb") as audio_file:
            response = await self.client.audio.transcriptions.create(
                model="whisper-1",
                file=audio_file,
                response_format=format,  # "text" or "verbose_json"
                language="en"  # Can be auto-detected or specified
            )
        return response
    
    def format_timestamps(self, segments: list) -> list:
        """
        Format timestamps using divmod approach from video
        """
        formatted_segments = []
        for segment in segments:
            start_minutes, start_seconds = divmod(segment['start'], 60)
            end_minutes, end_seconds = divmod(segment['end'], 60)
            
            formatted_segment = {
                "start_time": f"{int(start_minutes):02d}:{int(start_seconds):02d}",
                "end_time": f"{int(end_minutes):02d}:{int(end_seconds):02d}",
                "text": segment['text'],
                "confidence": 1.0 - segment.get('no_speech_prob', 0.0)
            }
            formatted_segments.append(formatted_segment)
        
        return formatted_segments
```

#### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
```python
class VideoProcessingError(Exception):
    """Custom exception for video processing errors"""
    pass

class TranscriptService:
    async def safe_download_video(self, url: str) -> VideoInfo:
        """
        Safe video download with error handling
        Based on video's mention of YouTube streaming changes
        """
        try:
            # Use yt-dlp with fallback strategies
            return await self.download_with_ytdlp(url)
        except Exception as e:
            if "youtube-dl" in str(e).lower():
                # Fallback to alternative approach if needed
                raise VideoProcessingError(f"Video download failed: {e}")
            raise
```

#### 5. Cost Management Features
```python
class CostTracker:
    """
    Track API usage costs as mentioned in video
    "keep on top of your cost caps"
    """
    
    def __init__(self, max_monthly_cost: float = 100.0):
        self.max_monthly_cost = max_monthly_cost
        self.current_month_usage = 0.0
    
    async def estimate_cost(self, audio_duration_seconds: float) -> float:
        """Estimate Whisper API cost based on audio duration"""
        # Whisper API pricing: $0.006 per minute
        cost_per_minute = 0.006
        duration_minutes = audio_duration_seconds / 60
        return duration_minutes * cost_per_minute
    
    async def check_cost_limit(self, estimated_cost: float) -> bool:
        """Check if processing would exceed cost limits"""
        projected_usage = self.current_month_usage + estimated_cost
        return projected_usage <= self.max_monthly_cost
```

### 6. Response Format Options
```python
class TranscriptResponseFormat:
    """
    Support different response formats as shown in video
    """
    
    @staticmethod
    def simple_text(segments: list) -> str:
        """Return simple concatenated text"""
        return " ".join(segment['text'] for segment in segments)
    
    @staticmethod
    def timestamped_segments(segments: list) -> list:
        """Return segments with formatted timestamps"""
        return [
            {
                "timestamp": f"{int(divmod(seg['start'], 60)[0]):02d}:{int(divmod(seg['start'], 60)[1]):02d}",
                "text": seg['text'],
                "confidence": 1.0 - seg.get('no_speech_prob', 0.0)
            }
            for seg in segments
        ]
    
    @staticmethod
    def detailed_analysis(segments: list) -> dict:
        """Return detailed analysis including tokens and probabilities"""
        return {
            "full_text": " ".join(seg['text'] for seg in segments),
            "segments": segments,
            "total_duration": max(seg['end'] for seg in segments),
            "average_confidence": sum(1.0 - seg.get('no_speech_prob', 0.0) for seg in segments) / len(segments)
        }
```

## Video-Specific Implementation Notes

### Key Code Patterns from Video
```python
# File handling pattern from video
input_file = "input.webm"  # Sanitized filename
output_file = "output.mp3"

# FFmpeg conversion pattern
ffmpeg_command = f"ffmpeg -i {input_file} -vn -acodec mp3 {output_file}"

# Whisper API call pattern
transcript = openai.Audio.transcribe(
    model="whisper-1",
    file=open(output_file, "rb"),
    response_format="verbose_json"  # For timestamp data
)

# Timestamp formatting pattern
for segment in transcript.segments:
    start_minutes, start_seconds = divmod(segment['start'], 60)
    timestamp = f"{int(start_minutes):02d}:{int(start_seconds):02d}"
```

### Production Considerations Beyond Video
1. **Concurrent Processing**: Video shows single-threaded approach
2. **Error Recovery**: Video doesn't cover retry strategies  
3. **Authentication**: Video uses local API key storage
4. **Monitoring**: Video lacks observability considerations
5. **Security**: Video doesn't address temporary file security

## Conclusion

The analyzed video provides excellent validation of our technology choices and offers practical implementation patterns. The demonstration confirms that our ADR-004 architecture is sound while providing specific implementation details that will accelerate development.

The video's 6-minute processing demonstration proves the feasibility of our "minutes not hours" processing goal, and the cost discussion validates our scalability assumptions.

We should proceed with implementation using the patterns demonstrated in the video as a foundation, while adding the enterprise-grade features (monitoring, security, error handling) needed for production deployment.
